To do :

#### Idea 1 - Add a permanent leaderboard

ex. 10 highest scores

- Learn how to connect my script to a text file or sqlite
- Create divs + style in the page to host the leaderboard
- Prompt for a Player Name at game end if new high score (check for limitations about length and types of characters, and high score limits and display)


#### Idea 2 - Make the game playable on phones
- Reduce the ratio of the grid div
- Add 4 buttons to control the direction of the snake
